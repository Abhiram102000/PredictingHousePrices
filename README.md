# PredictingHousePrices
Used a Machine Algorithm to predict houses of a given set of houses

This project is done using the files provided by University of Washington for the courses provided via Coursera

Objectives: 

1.Selection and summary statistics: We found the zip code with the highest average house price. What is the average house price of that zip code?

2.Filtering data: What fraction of the houses have living space between 2000 sq.ft. and 4000 sq.ft.?

3.Building a regression model with several more features: What is the difference in RMSE between the model trained with my_features and the one trained with advanced_features?
